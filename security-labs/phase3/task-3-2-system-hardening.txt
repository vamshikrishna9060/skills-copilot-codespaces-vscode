Task 3.2: System Hardening

Objective:
To understand system hardening techniques used to reduce the attack surface and improve overall system security.

1) What is System Hardening?
System hardening is the process of securing a system by reducing vulnerabilities, disabling unnecessary services, and applying secure configurations.

2) Key Hardening Areas
- Operating System
- Network Services
- User Accounts
- File Permissions
- Software Updates

3) Common System Hardening Techniques
- Disable unused services and ports
- Apply least privilege principle
- Enforce strong password policies
- Regularly update and patch software
- Enable logging and monitoring
- Configure firewalls

4) Example Hardening Commands (Conceptual)
(Note: Commands may be restricted in this environment)

- sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
- sudo systemctl disable unused-service
- chmod 600 sensitive_file
- ufw enable
- ufw allow ssh

5) Security Benefits
- Minimizes attack surface
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Reduces risk of privilege escalation
- Improves system resilience

6) Best Practices
- Harden systems before deployment
- Review configurations regularly
- Document all changes
- Combine hardening with monitoring

Conclusion:
System hardening is a foundational cybersecurity practice. A well-hardened system significantly lowers the chances of successful attacks and strengthens overall security posture.
