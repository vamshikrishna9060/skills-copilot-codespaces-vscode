Task 3.1: Vulnerability Scanning & Assessment

Objective:
To understand vulnerability scanning concepts and perform a basic vulnerability assessment on the local system using safe and controlled methods.

1) What is Vulnerability Scanning?
Vulnerability scanning is the process of identifying security weaknesses, misconfigurations, and outdated software that could be exploited by attackers. It helps organizations detect risks before they are abused.

2) Common Vulnerability Scanning Tools
- Nmap (with NSE scripts)
- OpenVAS
- Nessus
- Nikto
- Lynis (Linux security auditing)

3) Planned Commands (Localhost Only)
(Note: Commands may be restricted in this environment)

- nmap -sV localhost
- nmap --script vuln localhost
- lynis audit system

4) Observations
- Full vulnerability scans could not be executed due to restricted shell environment.
- Network and system commands are intercepted by the wrapper.
- No external targets were scanned to maintain ethical boundaries.

5) Risk Categories Identified (Conceptual)
- Open or unnecessary ports
- Outdated services
- Weak configurations
- Missing security patches

6) Security Importance
Regular vulnerability scanning:
- Reduces attack surface
- Helps maintain compliance
- Prevents privilege escalation
- Improves system hardening

7) Best Practices
- Scan only authorized systems
- Keep scanning tools updated
- Patch vulnerabilities immediately
- Perform scans periodically

Conclusion:
Vulnerability scanning is a critical defensive security practice. Even when tools are restricted, understanding scanning methodology is essential for proactive cybersecurity defense.
