Task 3.3: Incident Response Basics

Objective:
To understand the fundamentals of incident response and how organizations react to security incidents.

1) What is an Incident?
A security incident is any event that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems or data.

2) Examples of Security Incidents
- Malware infection
- Unauthorized access
- Data breach
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Phishing attack

3) Incident Response Lifecycle
- Preparation
- Identification
- Containment
- Eradication
- Recovery
- Lessons Learned

4) Preparation
Includes creating policies, incident response plans, training teams, and setting up monitoring tools.

5) Identification
Detecting and confirming that an incident has occurred using logs, alerts, and monitoring systems.

6) Containment
Limiting the spread or impact of the incident (e.g., isolating affected systems).

7) Eradication
Removing the root cause such as malware, malicious accounts, or vulnerabilities.

8) Recovery
Restoring systems to normal operation and monitoring for any signs of recurrence.

9) Lessons Learned
Reviewing the incident to improve future response and security controls.

Conclusion:
An effective incident response process minimizes damage, reduces recovery time, and strengthens an organization’s security posture.
