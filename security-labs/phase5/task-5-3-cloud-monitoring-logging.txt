Task 5.3: Cloud Monitoring & Logging

1) Importance of Cloud Monitoring
Cloud monitoring helps detect:
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Suspicious API activity
- Resource misuse
- Configuration changes

Without monitoring, cloud attacks often remain undetected for months.

2) Cloud Logging Sources
Common cloud logs include:
- IAM audit logs (authentication & authorization events)
- API activity logs
- Network flow logs
- Storage access logs
- Compute instance logs

Examples:
- AWS CloudTrail
- Azure Monitor
- Google Cloud Audit Logs

3) What to Monitor
Security teams should monitor:
- Failed login attempts
- Privilege escalation events
- Policy changes
- New key or user creation
- Unusual data downloads

4) Alerting & Detection
Monitoring alone is not enough.
Alerts should trigger when:
- High-risk actions occur
- Thresholds are exceeded
- Known attack patterns appear

SIEM tools help correlate logs across services.

5) Best Practices
- Enable logging for all regions
- Store logs securely and immutably
- Apply least-privilege access to logs
- Regularly review alerts and dashboards
- Integrate logs with SIEM

Conclusion:
Effective monitoring and logging are essential for detecting, responding to, and preventing cloud security incidents.
