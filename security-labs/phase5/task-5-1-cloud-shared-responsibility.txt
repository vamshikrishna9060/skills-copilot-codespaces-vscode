TASK 5.1 – CLOUD SHARED RESPONSIBILITY MODEL
Role: Cybersecurity Architect (Foundational Thinking)

OBJECTIVE
Understand who is responsible for security in cloud environments and why most real-world breaches happen due to misunderstanding responsibility boundaries.

This task is NOT about AWS commands.
This task is about ARCHITECTURAL THINKING.

--------------------------------------------------
1. WHAT IS THE SHARED RESPONSIBILITY MODEL?
--------------------------------------------------

The Cloud Shared Responsibility Model defines how security responsibilities are divided between:

• Cloud Service Provider (AWS / Azure / GCP)
• Customer (organization using the cloud)

The provider secures the CLOUD.
The customer secures what is IN the cloud.

This separation exists because cloud providers cannot control customer configurations, identities, or data usage without violating isolation and trust.

--------------------------------------------------
2. RESPONSIBILITY SPLIT (INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE – IaaS)
--------------------------------------------------

CLOUD PROVIDER RESPONSIBILITIES:
• Physical data center security
• Hardware (servers, disks, networking)
• Physical network infrastructure
• Hypervisor and virtualization layer
• Availability of cloud services

CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES:
• Identity & Access Management (IAM)
• Operating system configuration
• Network security groups & firewalls
• Application security
• Data encryption & classification
• Patch management (OS & apps)
• Logging and monitoring configuration

IMPORTANT:
Most cloud breaches occur because customers assume the provider protects them from misconfiguration. This assumption is false.

--------------------------------------------------
3. REAL BREACH EXAMPLE – S3 BUCKET EXPOSURE
--------------------------------------------------

Scenario:
An organization stores customer data in an S3 bucket.
The bucket is configured as public.

Who failed?

NOT AWS.
AWS provided access controls and warnings.
The CUSTOMER misconfigured permissions.

Root Cause:
• Misunderstanding IAM policies
• Lack of least-privilege design
• No monitoring or alerting

Architect Lesson:
Security failures are usually permission failures.

--------------------------------------------------
4. WHY ARCHITECTS CARE (NOT TOOL USERS)
--------------------------------------------------

A tool user asks:
“Which AWS service encrypts data?”

An architect asks:
“Who can access this data, from where, under what conditions, and how will I detect misuse?”

Architect focus areas:
• Trust boundaries
• Identity flows
• Permission inheritance
• Blast radius of compromise
• Logging and auditability

--------------------------------------------------
5. SHARED RESPONSIBILITY VS ON-PREMISE
--------------------------------------------------

On-Premise:
• Organization owns EVERYTHING
• Hardware to application
• Full control, full responsibility

Cloud:
• Reduced infrastructure burden
• Increased configuration risk
• Faster mistakes at larger scale

Architect takeaway:
Cloud does not reduce responsibility.
It shifts responsibility upward into identity, policy, and architecture decisions.

--------------------------------------------------
6. SECURITY PRINCIPLES CONNECTED
--------------------------------------------------

• Least Privilege – never grant broad access
• Zero Trust – never trust network location
• Defense in Depth – logging + IAM + network + encryption
• Accountability – every action must be traceable

--------------------------------------------------
7. ARCHITECT SELF-CHECK (IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------------------------

I understand this task if I can explain:

• Why AWS cannot protect me from my own IAM mistakes
• Why “public by default” is dangerous
• Why identity is the new security perimeter
• Why cloud security failures scale faster than on-prem failures

--------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY (IN MY OWN WORDS)
--------------------------------------------------

Cloud security is not about tools.
It is about responsibility boundaries.

The provider secures the infrastructure.
The customer secures identities, data, and configurations.

Most cloud breaches are not hacks.
They are design failures.

As a future cybersecurity architect, my job is to design systems
that remain secure even when humans make mistakes.
