Task 5.2: Cloud IAM & Attack Paths

1) IAM Fundamentals
Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls who can access cloud resources and what actions they can perform.
IAM is based on:
- Users (human or service identities)
- Roles (set of permissions)
- Policies (rules defining allowed or denied actions)

Misconfigured IAM is one of the biggest causes of cloud security breaches.

2) Common IAM Misconfigurations
- Over-privileged roles (using AdministratorAccess unnecessarily)
- Wildcard permissions (*)
- Unused or stale IAM users and keys
- No MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- Publicly accessible service accounts

3) Common Cloud Attack Paths
An attacker may follow this path:
- Compromise low-privileged credentials
- Enumerate IAM permissions
- Abuse role trust relationships
- Escalate privileges
- Access sensitive services (storage, databases, secrets)

Example attack path:
Compromised developer key → IAM role abuse → Access S3 / Cloud Storage → Data exfiltration

4) Real-World Cloud Breach Examples
- Public cloud storage exposed due to weak IAM policies
- CI/CD service accounts leaked via GitHub
- Over-permissive roles abused for crypto-mining

5) Security Best Practices
- Follow least privilege principle
- Enable MFA for all users
- Rotate access keys regularly
- Use IAM roles instead of long-term keys
- Monitor IAM logs and alerts

Conclusion:
Strong IAM configuration is critical to preventing cloud-based attack paths and data breaches.
