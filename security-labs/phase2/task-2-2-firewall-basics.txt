Task 2.2: Firewall Basics & Network Hardening

Objective:
Understand basic firewall concepts, view firewall status, and learn how firewalls help secure a system by controlling network traffic.

--------------------------------------------------
1) Firewall Concept Overview
--------------------------------------------------
A firewall is a security mechanism that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules. It acts as a barrier between trusted internal systems and untrusted external networks.

Key purposes of a firewall:
- Prevent unauthorized access
- Allow legitimate traffic
- Reduce attack surface
- Protect services running on the system

--------------------------------------------------
2) Firewall Types
--------------------------------------------------
Common firewall types include:

- Host-based firewalls (e.g., UFW, firewalld, iptables)
- Network firewalls (hardware or perimeter firewalls)
- Stateful firewalls
- Application-level firewalls

--------------------------------------------------
3) Firewall Status Check
--------------------------------------------------
Commands (may be restricted in Codespaces):

- sudo ufw status
- sudo iptables -L
- firewall-cmd --state

Observation:
- Firewall commands may be blocked or unavailable in this environment.
- Codespaces often run inside managed containers where firewall control is restricted.

--------------------------------------------------
4) Default Firewall Policy
--------------------------------------------------
Typical secure default policies:
- Deny all incoming traffic
- Allow all outgoing traffic
- Explicitly allow only required services (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)

This principle follows "default deny" security strategy.

--------------------------------------------------
5) Importance of Firewalls in Security
--------------------------------------------------
Firewalls help prevent:
- Port scanning attacks
- Unauthorized service access
- Malware communication
- Lateral movement inside networks

They are a critical first line of defense in system security.

--------------------------------------------------
6) Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------
Firewalls are essential for protecting systems from unauthorized network access. Even when direct configuration is restricted (as in cloud environments), understanding firewall behavior is vital for cybersecurity professionals.
