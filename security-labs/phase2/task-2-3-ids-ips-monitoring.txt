Task 2.3: IDS, IPS & Security Monitoring

1) IDS vs IPS Overview
IDS (Intrusion Detection System):
- Monitors network/system traffic
- Detects suspicious or malicious activity
- Generates alerts but does NOT block traffic
- Examples: Snort (IDS mode), Suricata (IDS)

IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):
- Monitors traffic in real time
- Detects AND blocks malicious activity
- Acts inline with network traffic
- Examples: Snort (IPS mode), Suricata (IPS), Palo Alto IPS

Observation:
IDS is used for visibility and alerting.
IPS is used for active protection and threat prevention.

--------------------------------------------------

2) Host-based vs Network-based Monitoring

Host-based Monitoring:
- Runs on individual systems
- Monitors logs, processes, file integrity
- Example tools: OSSEC, Wazuh, auditd

Network-based Monitoring:
- Monitors network traffic
- Detects scans, attacks, suspicious packets
- Example tools: Snort, Suricata, Zeek

Observation:
Host-based tools provide deep system insight.
Network-based tools provide broader attack visibility.

--------------------------------------------------

3) Log Monitoring & Analysis

Common Logs:
- Authentication logs
- Firewall logs
- Application logs
- System logs

Why Log Monitoring is Important:
- Detects brute-force attacks
- Identifies unauthorized access
- Helps in forensic investigations
- Required for compliance and audits

--------------------------------------------------

4) Security Relevance

IDS/IPS and monitoring help to:
- Detect attacks early
- Reduce attack impact
- Improve incident response
- Strengthen overall security posture

--------------------------------------------------

Conclusion:
IDS, IPS, and continuous monitoring are essential components of a secure system.
They provide visibility, detection, and prevention against modern cyber threats.
