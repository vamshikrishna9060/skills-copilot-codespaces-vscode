Task 2.1: TCP/IP Fundamentals & Scanning

1) Host Network Information
Commands: ifconfig (or ip addr), ip route show
Observation:
- Commands could not be executed in this shell (wrapper returns "Task 1.4: Network & Port Analysis").
- Pending: capture interface list, assigned IPs, and routes once wrapper is removed.

2) ARP Table & Local Discovery
Commands: arp -a, netstat -rn (or ip route), ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
Observation:
- Commands blocked by wrapper; no ARP entries captured.
- Pending: confirm default gateway and reachable neighbors after wrapper is cleared.

3) DNS Resolution Checks
Commands: nslookup google.com, dig google.com +short, dig -x 8.8.8.8
Observation:
- DNS lookups not executed due to wrapper.
- Pending: verify forward and reverse resolution once commands run normally.

4) Connectivity Verification
Commands: ping -c 1 8.8.8.8, curl -I https://example.com (optional)
Observation:
- Connectivity tests not run; awaiting unwrapped shell to validate egress and latency.

5) Port Scanning (Localhost)
Commands: nmap localhost; nmap -sV localhost; nmap -p 1-1000 localhost
Observation:
- nmap scans not executed because commands are intercepted.
- Plan: run localhost scans to inventory listening services; keep scans to local host only.

Conclusion:
- Task initialized; command output collection is blocked by the current shell wrapper. Once an unwrapped shell is available, rerun the listed commands, record actual outputs, and reassess listening services and connectivity.
