Task 1.2 – Process Baseline Analysis

Commands Used:
ps aux
top
htop (if available)

Analysis:
I collected a baseline of running processes on the system to understand normal behavior.
Most processes belong to system services, user shell sessions, and Codespaces components.
No suspicious or unknown processes were observed during baseline collection.

Security Importance:
Maintaining a process baseline helps in detecting anomalies such as malware, backdoors,
or unauthorized services running on the system.

Conclusion:
This baseline will be used for future comparison during incident response or threat hunting.
