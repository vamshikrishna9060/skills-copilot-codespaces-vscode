Task 1.3 - File Permission Audit

Commands Used:
ls -la
find / -type f -perm -0002 2>/dev/null
find / -type d -perm -0002 2>/dev/null

Analysis:
I reviewed file and directory permissions to identify world-writable resources.
World-writable files can be modified by any user, which may allow privilege escalation
or data tampering if misconfigured.

Most world-writable directories observed were standard system locations such as /tmp,
which are protected using the sticky bit to prevent unauthorized file deletion.

Security Risk:
Improper permissions can allow attackers to replace binaries, inject malicious scripts,
or alter sensitive configuration files.

Conclusion:
Regular permission audits are critical for maintaining system integrity and preventing
privilege escalation attacks.
