SOC-1 Lab 2 – False Positive Analysis

1. What is a false positive?
A false positive is an alert that looks suspicious but is actually
legitimate activity.

2. Example of false positive:
- User enters wrong password multiple times
- VPN reconnect causes repeated logins
- Admin testing SSH access

3. How SOC analysts reduce false positives:
- Check source IP reputation
- Verify user identity
- Correlate with other logs
- Look for successful login after failures

4. Difference between attack and false positive:
Attack:
- Continuous failures
- Multiple usernames
- No successful login
- External IP

False Positive:
- Few attempts
- Known user
- Successful login occurs
- Internal IP

5. Learning:
Not every alert is an attack. Context matters.
