SOC-1 Lab 3 – Alert Severity & Incident Triage

1. What is incident triage?
Incident triage is the process of analyzing alerts to decide
their severity and required response.

2. Alert severity levels:
- Low: Informational, no immediate risk
- Medium: Suspicious behavior, needs monitoring
- High: Confirmed malicious activity
- Critical: Active attack impacting systems

3. Example classifications:
- One failed login → Low
- Multiple failed logins → Medium
- SSH brute force detected → High
- Successful breach + data exfiltration → Critical

4. SOC analyst actions:
Low:
- Log and close

Medium:
- Monitor
- Add context
- Watch for escalation

High:
- Escalate to Tier-2
- Block IP
- Preserve logs

Critical:
- Immediate escalation
- Incident response
- Notify management

5. Learning:
Correct severity prevents alert fatigue and ensures
real threats get immediate attention.
