SOC Lab 0.3 – SSH Attack Observation

1. What is an SSH brute force attack?
An SSH brute force attack is when an attacker repeatedly tries different passwords to gain unauthorized access to a system via SSH.

2. Typical log indicators
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Repeated attempts from the same IP
- Short time gap between attempts
- Attempts for common usernames (root, admin, ubuntu)

3. Example log pattern
Failed password for root from 192.168.1.100 port 54321 ssh2

4. When does this become suspicious?
- More than 5 failures from the same IP
- Failures within a short time window
- Attempts across multiple usernames

5. SOC analyst action
- Validate the IP address
- Check if IP is internal or external
- Look for successful login after failures
- Escalate if brute force is confirmed

6. One thing I learned
Repeated failed logins are early warning signs of an attack.
