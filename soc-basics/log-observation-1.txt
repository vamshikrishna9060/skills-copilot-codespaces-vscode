SOC Lab 0.1 – Log Observation

1. What is a log?
A log is a record of events generated by the system or applications. It shows what happened, when it happened, and sometimes who did it.

2. Difference between logs and alerts
Logs are raw event data. Alerts are created when logs match suspicious rules or patterns.

3. Why logs are important for a SOC Analyst
Logs help SOC analysts detect attacks, investigate incidents, and understand system behavior.

4. One thing I learned today
I learned that SOC analysts observe logs first before responding to alerts or incidents.
