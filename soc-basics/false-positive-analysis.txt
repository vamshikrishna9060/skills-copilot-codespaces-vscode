SOC Lab 0.4 – False Positive Analysis

1. What is a false positive?
A false positive is an alert that looks suspicious but is actually legitimate activity.

2. Common false positives in SOC
- Users mistyping passwords
- Scheduled system scans
- Backup jobs accessing many files
- Developers logging in from new IPs

3. Example scenario
A user fails login 3 times and then succeeds.
This is likely a typo, not an attack.

4. How SOC analysts reduce false positives
- Check user behavior history
- Correlate with time, IP, and success logs
- Verify business context
- Suppress known benign patterns

5. Why false positives are dangerous
- Alert fatigue
- Missed real attacks
- Wasted analyst time

6. One thing I learned
Not every alert is an incident; investigation determines reality.
