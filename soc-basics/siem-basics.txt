SOC-1 Lab 1.0 – SIEM Basics

1. What is a SIEM?
A SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system collects, stores, and analyzes logs from multiple sources.

2. Why SIEM is important in SOC
SIEM helps SOC analysts detect threats by correlating events across systems.

3. Example log sources
- Firewall logs
- Authentication logs
- Endpoint logs
- Application logs

4. What is log correlation?
Log correlation means linking multiple related events to identify suspicious activity.

5. Example correlation
- Multiple failed logins
- Followed by a successful login
- From the same IP
→ Possible brute-force attack

6. One thing I learned
SIEM turns raw logs into actionable security alerts.
