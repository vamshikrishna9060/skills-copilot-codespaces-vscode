SOC Lab 0.5 – Incident Triage

1. What is incident triage?
Incident triage is the process of prioritizing alerts based on risk and impact.

2. Severity levels
Low: Normal behavior or false positives
Medium: Suspicious activity needing investigation
High: Confirmed malicious activity
Critical: Active breach or data exfiltration

3. Example triage scenarios
- Single failed login → Low
- Multiple failed logins from one IP → Medium
- Malware detected on endpoint → High
- Data exfiltration detected → Critical

4. SOC analyst actions
Low: Document and monitor
Medium: Investigate logs and context
High: Escalate to Tier-2
Critical: Trigger incident response immediately

5. One thing I learned
Correct triage prevents panic and protects the organization.
