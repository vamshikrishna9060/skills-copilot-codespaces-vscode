SOC Lab 0.2 – Alert Thinking

1. What is an alert?
An alert is a notification generated when log data matches suspicious rules or known attack patterns.

2. Example of log vs alert
Log: Failed SSH login from IP 10.0.0.5
Alert: Multiple failed SSH logins detected from same IP (possible brute force)

3. Why SOC analysts trust logs more than alerts
Alerts can be false positives. Logs show the full truth and context.

4. What a SOC analyst does after receiving an alert
- Validate the alert
- Check related logs
- Decide if it is malicious or benign
- Escalate if required

5. One thing I learned
Alerts are starting points, not conclusions.
